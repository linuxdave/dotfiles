My dotfiles! Hooray!

### What is this repository for? ###

* Just a collection of my dotfiles I use across systems. 

### How do I get set up? ###

* Backup any existing dotfiles you're replacing.
* Replace with symlinks: 
    ln -s ~/Projects/DotFiles/vim/ ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/Projects/DotFiles/vimrc ~/.vimrc

* I used [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for the theme.


### Who do I talk to? ###

* Email me linuxdave@gmail.com
